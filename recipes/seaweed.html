                <h2>Description</h2>

                <p style="font-size: 28px;">Mochi is a sweet, short-grained, very chewy rice with a high starch content. This is a traditional Japanese dish, and one of the best in winters. It is eaten in wrapped Nori which is also known as Dry Seaweed. This amazing dish will take you only about 17 minutes to cook, and the servings will depend on how many Mochi and Seaweed strips you take. In this recipe, we'll be making 8 servings.</p>

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
