            <p>Welcome! You must be wondering what kind of recipes page has only 3 recipes! Well, that's</p>
            <p>because these were made by Vikings! You've been fed lies by History about the origin of certain</p>
            <p>dishes! Get ready to hear the painful story behind the last two recipes, the story of how Vikings</p>
            <p>came up with them and were killed. These dishes have been modified over the years (apparently,</p>
            <p>Vikings had no ovens, cheese, or a 6-inch non-stick skillet.) Also, did you know that Vikings</p>
            <p>visited Japan at some point? Well of course they did! They had ships remember? They traveled</p>
            <p>around the world with them, gathering experience and conquering lands! Well, let's not waste</p>
            <p>any time and dig into the 3 recipes!</p>

            <ol>
                <li><p><a href="./recipes/cheese-tomato-omelet.html">Cream Cheese and Tomato Omelet with Chives Recipe</a></p>
                    <p>Vikings loved traditional Indian tomato omelets which also contained chillis. Over the</p>
                    <p>years, to make it tastier and remove spiciness, the chillis were replaced with</p>
                    <p>cheese. You can make the traditional one if you like spicy. Although the ingredients and</p>
                    <p>steps aren't discussed.</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><p><a href="./recipes/florentine.html">Eggs Florentine Recipe</a></p>
                    <p>Here comes the second one! Vikings traveled from their homeland of Scandinavia to the</p>
                    <p>streets of Florentia (modern-day Florence) and they made this sweet and salty dish</p>
                    <p>inspired by the cuisines there. However, the <em>Florentians</em> called it their own and the</p>
                    <p>Vikings who fought back were assassinated by Ezio Auditore da Firenze and his band</p>
                    <p>of assassins!</p>
                    <p><em>"We work in the dark to serve the light."</em> They should probably replace 'light' with 'Italy.'</p>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><p><a href="./recipes/seaweed.html">Broiled Mochi with Nori Seaweed Recipe</a></p>
                    <p>And here comes the final one! Vikings traveled far away to Japan and came across Mochi</p>
                    <p>and Seaweed and created this masterpiece! Apparently, no one in Japan thought of wrapping</p>
                    <p>Mochi with Seaweed before. After the Vikings came up with it, everyone fell in love with</p>
                    <p>this dish! Sadly, to not let the world find out that Vikings came up with it, legends like</p>
                    <p>Uchiha Sasuke, Kurosaki Ichigo, Kujo Jotaro, and Tsugikuni Yoriichi to name a few, silenced</p>
                    <p>them! (And here I thought Sasuke was the good guy since he tried to get rid of Trashura.)</p>
                
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Go on and try these dishes at home! Make sure you spread the word about this painful story of</p>
            <p>Vikings. #JusticeForVikings</p>

            <p><strong>P.S.</strong><em>Every information given on this page about Vikings is utterly false! Don't go around spouting this non-sense in public, if you do, then don't blame me if you get smacked by a bunch of Italians, Japanese, or Historians.</em></p>
