            Welcome! You must be wondering what kind of recipes page has only 3 recipes! Well, that's because these were made by Vikings! You've been fed lies by History about the origin of certain dishes! Get ready to hear the painful story behind the last two recipes, the story of how Vikings came up with them and were killed. These dishes have been modified over the years (apparently, Vikings had no ovens, cheese, or a 6-inch non-stick skillet.) Also, did you know that Vikings visited Japan at some point? Well of course they did! They had ships remember? They traveled around the world with them, gathering experience and conquering lands! Well, let's not waste any time and dig into the 3 recipes!

                <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Click the recipe you like! My favorite's the third one <strong style="color: black; font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;">(I'M NOT AN OTAKU!)</strong></p>

            <ol>
                <li><p><a class="recipe" href="./recipes/cheese-tomato-omelet.html">Cream Cheese and Tomato Omelet with Chives Recipe</a></p>
                    Vikings loved traditional Indian tomato omelets which also contained chillis. Over the years, to make it tastier and remove spiciness, the chillis were replaced with cheese. You can make the traditional one if you like spicy. Although the ingredients and steps aren't discussed.

                <li><p><a class="recipe" href="./recipes/florentine.html">Eggs Florentine Recipe</a></p>
                    Here comes the second one! Vikings traveled from their homeland of Scandinavia to the streets of Florentia (modern-day Florence) and they made this sweet and salty dish inspired by the cuisines there. However, the <em>Florentians</em> called it their own and the Vikings who fought back were assassinated by Ezio Auditore da Firenze and his band of assassins! 
                    <div><em>"We work in the dark to serve the light."</em> They should probably replace 'light' with 'Italy.'</div>
                </li>
                
                <li><p><a class="recipe" href="./recipes/seaweed.html">Broiled Mochi with Nori Seaweed Recipe</a></p>
                    And here comes the final one! Vikings traveled far away to Japan and came across Mochi and Seaweed and created this masterpiece! Apparently, no one in Japan thought of wrapping Mochi with Seaweed before. After the Vikings came up with it, everyone fell in love with this dish! Sadly, to not let the world find out that Vikings came up with it, legends like Uchiha Sasuke, Kurosaki Ichigo, Kujo Jotaro, and Tsugikuni Yoriichi to name a few, silenced them! (And here I thought Sasuke was the good guy since he tried to get rid of Trashura.)                
                </li>
            </ol>

            Go on and try these dishes at home! Make sure you spread the word about this painful story of
            Vikings. #JusticeForVikings
